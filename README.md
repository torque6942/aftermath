A little Quake project

This is just a simple Quake project I've started. I have some ideas of what I want this to become but nothing big yet.
My main goal is to increase the feeling of damage dealing while slowing the pace and still keeping it fun.

0.03
- Added secondary fire trigger
- Added 3 burst secondary fire to shotgun (inspired by Doom 2016)
- Added small hp recovery in backpacks dropped by enemies
	(also inspired by Doom 2016, amount random but dependent on your current hp)

0.02
- Removed delay for changing/drawing weapon

0.01
- Added new model for shotgun
- Added new sounds for shotgun (also changed the fire sound for Grunt)
- Slowed rate of fire for shotgun
- Increased damage for shotgun
- Initialized delay for changing/drawing weapon
- Added new gibbing sound (taken from Quake 2)
